When it comes to styling websites, developers have long relied on traditional CSS or pre-processors like Sass. However, utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS have gained massive popularity. So, which approach is better?

## Traditional CSS: The Classic Approach

Traditional CSS provides full control over styles, allowing developers to define custom class names and apply styles globally. It's ideal for projects requiring complete design freedom, but it often leads to:

- **Long Stylesheets** – Maintaining large stylesheets can become cumbersome.
- **Naming Challenges** – Choosing meaningful class names can be tricky.
- **Specificity Issues** – Overriding styles can lead to unintentional conflicts.

## Tailwind CSS: A Utility-First Framework

Tailwind takes a different approach by offering pre-defined utility classes. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose styles directly in your HTML:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">Click Me</button>
```

## Benefits of Tailwind:

- Faster Development – No need to switch between CSS and HTML files.
- Consistent Design – Encourages reusable design patterns.
- Smaller CSS Files – With PurgeCSS, unused styles are removed.

## Which One Should You Use?

If you prefer complete control and don’t mind managing stylesheets, traditional CSS is still a great option. However, if you want to speed up development and keep styles consistent, Tailwind CSS is a powerful alternative.
